## 🧭 Overview

**Shell Chat** is a terminal-first messaging platform designed to feel fast, readable, and reliable. Instead of flooding the console with endless logs, the interface **re-renders intelligently on every action**, keeping context front and center.

The system currently uses a **local database** for storage, but its architecture is intentionally future-proof: move the database to a server, and Shell Chat transitions cleanly into an **online system** without architectural pain.

## 🧠 Architecture Philosophy

Shell Chat is built on a simple but strict idea:

> **If the data source changes, the app should not care.**

The logic layer is decoupled from storage and presentation, allowing the system to evolve from a local CLI tool into a networked application with minimal friction.
